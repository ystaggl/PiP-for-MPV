# PiP-for-MPV
A script that allows MPV to run in Picture-in-Picture mode, with other quality of life functionality.
This project is deprecated. It started as one of my early AutoHotKey scripts which I eventually converted into python when I was first learning the langugae.
As such, the code is terrible and more importantly, the project is obsolete, as most of the functions are already supported by mpv natively, just by making changes to the input.ini file.

# Usage
Runs separately to MPV, just run the exe (or .py), and it should work immediately

Simply press the hotkeys while scroll lock is on to run the respective scripts

# Functions
F1: Toggle whether the mpv window has a border for resizing

F2: Set mpv to a Picture-in-Picture window.

F3: Reset mpv to a normal window.

F4: Toggle Autoplay
