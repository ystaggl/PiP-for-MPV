# PiP-for-MPV
A script that allows MPV to run in Picture-in-Picture mode, with other quality of life functionality

# Usage
Runs as a separate to MPV, just run the exe (or ahk, if you have AutoHotKey installed) file, and it should work immediately

# Versions
There are two versions, the simplified version and the full version. 

The simplified version only has the F1, F2 and F3 functions, use whichever you prefer

If there are certain functions you want to disable, download the .ahk file, open it with a text editor, and add a \# symbol before the function (e.g. to disable F8, change line 135 from F8:: to \#F8::)

# Functions
F1: Put mpv in Picture-in-Picture mode

F2: Toggle whether mpv window can be resized or repositioned

F3: Reset mpv window


Only for non-simplified version:

F4: Toggle mpv window transparency

F5: Toggle cursor visibility, this is especially useful for certain games that have issues when in borderless mode (e.g. Monster Hunter: World)

F6: If using Taiga (taiga.moe), plays next episode

F7: If using Taiga (taiga.moe), Toggles whether next episode should autoplay

F8: If using Taiga (taiga.moe), Toggles whether taiga should be hidden
